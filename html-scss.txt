SCSS
=========================
1. what is mixin?
    @mixin directive can be used to define css code which will be reused in the application.
    To include the mixin we have to use @import directive 

    @mixing base-design{
        color: black;
        background-color: white;
        font-size: 14px;
    }

    .user-info{
        @include base-design;
    }

2. what is @import
    @import allows you to include one scss file into another which means you can define common css code 
    in common files and reuse it.

    @import "variables" // no need of extension

3. what is @extend
    The @extend directive lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.

    .button{
        padding: 20px;
        font-size: 14px;
    }
    .primary-button{
        @extend .button;
        color: white;
        background-color: red;
    }
    .secondary-button{
        @extend .button
        color: red;
        background-color: white;
    }

4. Sass function

    for e..g, quote(Hello world!)   // "Hello world!"
